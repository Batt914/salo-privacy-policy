Refund & Cancellation Policy

SALO is a service-based application that allows users to book salon and beauty
services through our platform. Once a booking is confirmed and payment is
successfully completed, cancellations are allowed only before the service
provider accepts the booking.

If a user cancels a booking within the allowed cancellation window, the refund
will be initiated to the original payment method. No refund will be provided
for cancellations made after the service has started or after the booking time.

In case the service provider cancels the booking or fails to deliver the
service, the user is eligible for a full refund. Refunds, if approved, will be
processed within 5 to 7 working days.

SALO is not responsible for delays caused by banks or payment gateways.
For any refund-related queries, users can contact our support team.
